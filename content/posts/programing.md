I’ve been involved in IT for about 30 years (gulp). Started out programming trading applications or a large bank in London, then moved to the U.S. where I programmed for another large bank until eventually (and reluctantly) I moved into management. I still program today, albeit on my personal projects (right now, I’m exploring rust).

Here are some of the programming languages I’ve used over the years….

I’ve also used several different databases…

I’ve been involved in IT for about 30 years (gulp). Started out building trading applications for a large bank in London, then moved to the U.S. where I continued to build trading applications for another large bank in New York. Eventually (and reluctantly) I moved into management. I still program today, albeit on my personal projects (right now, I’m exploring rust).

Here are some of the programming languages I’ve used over the years….

I’ve also used several different databases:
